    "### Jonathan's pearls of wisdom\n",
    "\n",
    "This goes back to my second paper, where we analyzed Galileo/NIMS data with FROSTIE. Jonathan's comment on my question 'What new science are we doing by analyzing the same data but with a different method?'\n",
    "\n",
    "*Galileo/NIMS data is not of very high quality. Moreover, the previous analysis have not accounted for the uncertainties in the measurements. Hence, even spectra that statistically look the same (look at the figure of S1, S2 and S3 above with SNR=10), have resulted in different hydrate abundances, because they were fitted without accounting for the error-bars. With Bayesian analysis, we can analyze them for a range of uncertainties and provide quantitative evidence on whether the spectra represent different compositions or not.*\n",
    "\n",
    "It seems like there are two approaches for doing science:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. You find out the un-answered questions in science (planetary science/astronomy in my case), and then try to find datasets that can help solve them. This is the aproach Alex likes (as confirmed by Nic's comments). I guess this is also the approach one takes when applying for time on telescope, etc.\n",
    "2. You get a new dataset and do a pre-liminary exploration of the dataset, which usually generates a lot of questions. \n",
    "\n",
    "So you start with the question and then look at the data, or the other way round. \n"

    "    - Europa's surface is an open system, hence the CO$_2$ on the surface can escape into the atmosphere. This implies a constant source of replenishment for the carbon seen on surface. \n",
    "    - CO$_2$ is very volatile and so should not be present on Europa's surface, unless its trapped in calthrates. Tentative evidence for it comes from the shift in the 4.85 $\\mu$m feature of the calthrate-trapped CO$_2$ ice, which brings it very closed to the position of the feature observed on Europa.\n",

    "4.  Hansen and McCord (2008) found strong correlation of CO$_2$ with dark regions on Europa. Among the three spectra I am analyzing, $S1$ and $S2$ lie in the dark region, while $S3$ lies outside it. Hence, $S1$ and $S2$ should show high evidence of CO$_2$, while $S3$ should not.\n",
