You are a bit of a prisoner of the model's approach. That is, for each step in your Bayesian grid-array, you need to assume a single value of D for each grain type and apply it to all wavelengths. You are currently forced to use the slab approximation expression only to compute $\\langle D \\rangle$ from your assumed $D$. This expression would be most accurate at the wavelengths for which the imaginary index, $n_i$, is smallest. So inverting the expression at the best wavelength would give you the best estimate of $D$ if computed from $D$.  Unfortunately, $\\langle D \\rangle$ varies with wavelength and you need a fixed $D$ for all wavelengths.*\n",
